# Hackathon2021-ML-Project
The objective of this work was to predict, within a telecommunications company, if a customer would upgrade his mobile device, i.e. if, for example, he had an iPhone 6, to determine if the customer would be willing to purchase a newer model iPhone such as an iPhone 8 or an iPhone 10.
10 files were provided with different variables each, within which each customer could be identified by a unique line_id.
By means of these files and the information recorded in the activity, data and behavior of each customer, a predictive model had to be made to achieve the desired result, having as final result or deliverable a file with two columns: in the first one, the customer's line_id and in the second one a 0 or a 1 that indicates whether the customer will upgrade or not.
